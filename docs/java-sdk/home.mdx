    Essential library extensions for Kafka Streams<span className={'text-orange-500'}>.</span>
</div>

The Responsive Java SDK adds the following capabilities to open source Kafka Streams:

* a disaggregated state architecture, with support for MongoDB, Cassandra, JBDC (coming soon), and DynamoDB (coming soon) as state backends.
* async processing, which enables you to call external services from your Kafka Streams app without impacting throughput.
* Row-level TTL for Responsive `StateStores`, which gives fine grain control on expiring data from your state stores.
