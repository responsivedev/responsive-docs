# Changelog

## Jan 27, 2025

### Kafka Client (0.38.0)

‚ùó[responsive-pub/415](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/415)
Changed the configuration of MongoDB to use `responsive.mongo.connection.string` instead of the old
`responsive.mongo.endpoint` (removing the need for separate `responsive.mongo.username` and
`responsive.mongo.password` configurations) to be more canonical with MongoDB guidelines and compatible
with more alternatives (e.g. DocumentDB).

## Jan 14, 2025

### Kafka Client (0.38.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/411](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/411):
**Prefix Scan Support**: this commit adds support for prefix scans on MongoDB, Cassandra & In Memory
Responsive stores.

‚ú® [responsive-pub/409](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/409):
**Configurable tombstone retention**: this change makes the default 12h to clean up deleted rows configurable
using `responsive.mongo.tombstone.retention.seconds`.

üêõ [responsive-pub/412](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/412):
**TTD Async Support**: this commit fixes a bug in the `ResponsiveTopologyTestDriver` that prevented
async processing from properly working.

‚ùó[responsive-pub/407](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/407)

### Kafka Client (0.37.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/403](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/403):
**Apache Kafka 3.8 and Kafka Spring 3.3 Support**: this commit makes the necessary changes to run
Responsive with kafka 3.8.1 and kafka-spring 3.3. Note that we recommend you use Kafka Streams as a
transitive dependency of Responsive `kafka-client` to avoid class loading issues.

üêõ [responsive-pub/396](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/396):
**TTD Async Support**: this commit fixes a bug in the `ResponsiveTopologyTestDriver` that prevented
async processing from properly working.

## Nov 19, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.34.0)

‚ùó[responsive-pub/387](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/387)
**Responsive Business Source License** is the project license for the Responsive Kafka Client. You
can obtain a copy of the license [here](https://www.responsive.dev/legal/responsive-bsl-10). Version
`0.33.0` was the last version shipped under the Apache 2.0 License.

‚ú® [responsive-pub/394](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/394):
**MongoDB Window Range Queries** are now supported in the default Window Store implemenetation in MongoDB.

## Nov 1, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.32.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/370](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/370):
**Row-level ttl** is now available for Responsive key-value stores. You can now define a default ttl as well
as a function that computes a row-level override for an individual records from the key, value, or both.
See the "Row-level ttl" section of the [State Stores](/sdk/stores) documentation for more details on this
feature and instructions on how to use it.

## Aug 20, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.27.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/331](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/331):
**Async Processing** now supports all PAPI topologies with any number of async processors. The very first version of
the Responsive Async Processor limited applications to only one async processor per topology. This limitation has
now been lifted.
See [the async processing documentation](/sdk/async-processing) for the latest state of the feature and how to use it.

## Jun 10, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.25.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/268](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/268):
**Async Processing** is now available in `ResponsiveKafkaStreams`. Async processing allows Kafka Streams
applications to concurrently process records within a single task, thus changing the upper limit of parallelization
from the level of a Kafka partition to the level of a record key.
See [the documentation](/sdk/async-processing) for more information.

üêõ [responsive-pub/292](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/292):
Adds back a previously truncated metric (last rebalance seconds ago).

‚ùó[responsive-pub/301](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/301):
As of 0.25.0, changelog truncation is no longer supported.

### Operator (0.15.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/274](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/274)
This is the first in a chain of pull requests that allows for actions to be triggered
remotely from the Responsive Controller (such as restarting a pod).

## Apr 5, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.23.0)

‚ùó[responsive-pub/269](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/269)
This is a backwards incompatible change to the way we name configurations. See
the PR description for a migration guide.

## Mar 6, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.22.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/248](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/248):
Responsive now supports all window stores, including **Session Stores**!

### Operator (0.13.0)

‚ú® [responsive-pub/257](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/257)
The cooldown for the policy execution is now configurable, so you can schedule more
aggressive policies if your application is sensitive to throughput changes.

## Feb 26, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.20.0)

üêõ [responsive-pub/249](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/249):

Responsive storage solutions.

üêõ [responsive-pub/230](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/230):
Changes the default Cassandra consistency levels to QUORUM/QUORUM and allows configuration
via config.

## Feb 13, 2024

### Kafka Client (0.16.0)

‚ú®**GA for MongoDB Stores**:
MongoDB is now considered generally available and supports nearly all of the
Kafka Streams operations, including IQ and windowed stores.

‚ú®[responsive-pub/221](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/221):
We made various improvements to performance, including this super cool PR to
maintain local per-window bloom filters to avoid looking data up in remote storage
if it's known not to exist during a window.

## Dec 18, 2023

### Kafka Client (0.15.0)


‚ú®[responsive-pub/163](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/163):
This change supports backing MongoDB storage! With the release, MongoDB is still
in Beta but supports EOS and KV Tables.

‚ú®[responsive-pub/181](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/181):
Cassandra implementation now supports Window stores!

‚ú®[responsive-pub/191](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/191):
You no longer need to configure OTEL agent in order to integrate with Responsive.
Simply set `responsive.metrics.enabled=true` in your configuration file along with
the API key/secret provided.

‚ú®[responsive-pub/167](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/167):
This is one of many PRs that have improved out metric suite to include a bunch
of new metrics. Some of my personal favorites:
- Metrics around the current kafka streams state (`RUNNING`, `REBALANCING`, etc...)
- Some metrics around the Responsive Cache effectiveness
- Additional metrics around restoration/thread errors

### Breaking Changes (Code Incompatibility)

#### Kakfa Client (0.14.0)

‚ùó[responsive-pub/134](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/134)
and [responsive-pub/135](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/135)
changed the way a new instance of `ResponsiveKafkaStreams` is created. These
changes apply to `dev.responsive.kafka-client` versions `0.14.0` and above.

Please modify your code to use the constructor in place of the static factory
method:

```diff showLineNumbers
-  KafkaStreams streams = ResponsiveKafkaStreams.create(...);
+  KafkaStreams streams = new ResponsiveKafkaStreams(...);
```

It also removed the timestamped versions of the `StoreSuppliers` since all
Responsive store implementations are compatible with timestamps. To create a
timestamped store, you now only need to specify it in one place: the `StoreBuilder`.
For a timestamped KeyValueStore you will still be using the
`ResponsiveStores#timestampedKeyValueStoreBuilder` API, but can now pass in any kind
of `KeyValueBytesStoreSupplier` provided by `ResponsiveStores`.  You can apply all
of these changes to your application code with the following `sed` commands:

```bash
FILE="<application-code-file-path>"
sed -ie "s|ResponsiveKafkaStreams.create|new ResponsiveKafkaStreams|g" ${FILE}
sed -ie "s|ResponsiveKeyValueParams.timestamped|ResponsiveKeyValueParams.keyValue|g" ${FILE}
sed -ie "s|ResponsiveKeyValueParams.timestampedFact|ResponsiveKeyValueParams.fact|g" ${FILE}
sed -ie "s|ResponsiveStores.timestampedKeyValueStore|ResponsiveStores.keyValueStore|g" ${FILE}
```

‚ùó[responsive-pub/148](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/148):
This change restructured code to distinguish between public apis and
internal implementation classes. Some classes, therefore, may have slightly
shifted package names. If your application fails to compile after Responsive client
versions, remove the imports that are not found and re-import them with the same
class name.

### Kafka Client (0.14.0)

‚ú®[responsive-pub/133](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/133):
Support configuring changelog truncation. This feature will allow you to
optionally truncate changelogs when using Responsive stores to reduce storage
utilization on your Kafka cluster. We recommend leaving the changelog enabled as
an additional source of data recovery. Responsive guarantees durability of your
records independently from this features.

‚ú®[responsive-pub/144](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/144):
Responsive now supports `GlobalKTables`! You can now create `GlobalKTables`
backed by Responsive's remote storage. Plugging them into your Streams
application is just as easy (and in fact exactly the same) as configuring a
regular KTable or KeyValueStore using `ResponsiveStores`:

```java
    final GlobalKTable<Long, Long> globalTable = builder.globalTable(
        GLOBAL_TOPIC,
        ResponsiveStores.materialized(ResponsiveKeyValueParams.keyValue(STORE_NAME))
    );
```

‚ú® [responsive-pub/150](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/150):
Responsive platform is now compatible with all topology optimizations, including
the previously restricted config option `reuse.ktable.source.topics`. This
optimization enables source KTables to reuse their input topic as a changelog,
avoiding the need to duplicate the source topic contents.  Note that this
optimization is incompatible with the new changelog truncation feature, however, and
applying it will automatically disable changelog truncation for all source KTables.


üêõ [responsive-pub/119](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/119):
Fixes a bug in the handling of writes with a `null` value so that they are
correctly identified as a tombstone.

üêõ [responsive-pub/146](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/146):
Fixes an (internal) bug where the internal property `grace_gc_seconds` was not
correctly configured for state stores with TTL enabled.

### Operator (0.14.0)

‚ú®[responsive-pub/120](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/120):
The [Expected Latency Diagnoser](https://docs.responsive.dev/reference/controller-policies#expected-latency)
was introduced, which allows you to specify a goal for the expected  latency
of a record being processed by a subtopology. The "expected latency" is defined
here as the amount of time between when the record is enqueued on the source
topic and the point at which it has finished being processed through the
subtopology.

‚ú®[responsive-pub/131](https://github.com/responsivedev/responsive-pub/pull/131):
Introduced the [Thread Saturation Diagnoser](https://docs.responsive.dev/reference/controller-policies#thread-saturation),
which will scale down the number of nodes in your application if threads are not
being fully utilized.
