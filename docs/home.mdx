    Reliable, Scalable, and Automated Kafka Streams<span className={'text-orange-500'}>.</span>
</div>

Responsive is a Kafka Streams solution that improves the reliability, scalability, and operability of Kafka Streams by

* Separating compute from storage,
* Providing load based autoscaling,
* Adding async processing,
* Offering a cloud-native managed state store,
* And more.

Stop fighting with restoration, rebalancing, and resource management. Responsive's [Java SDK](//java-sdk),
[Control plane](/control-plane), and [storage options](/storage) collectively separate state from
compute, automate operations, and maintains 100% compatibility with your existing code.

# Architecture Overview

The first two principles, separating storage from compute and automating operations, require
changing the architecture of Kafka Streams to look like this:

<img
    alt={"architecture"}
    src={require('/static/img/docs/concepts/architecture/architecture.png').default}
    className={'px-[10%] mb-4'} />

Let's dig into how this all fits together. The entire ecosystem consists of the following "players":

1. **A Kafka Cluster**. Responsive is agnostic to the Kafka Cluster -- it can run self-hosted in your VPC,
in some Cloud Provider (such as Confluent, Redpanda or Warpstream) or even locally for testing.
1. **Your Kafka Streams Applications**. Represented in the diagram above as `java` boxes, these applications
run on your hardware in your network. To take advantage of the Responsive autoscaling capabilities,
these apps must run on an orchestration framework such as Kubernetes.
1. **The Responsive Operator**. Responsive provides a Helm chart to deploy the operator inside your network.
This component manages your Kafka Streams Applications, configuring and scaling up and down based
on signals it polls from the Responsive Controller.
1. **The Responsive Controller**. Responsive deploys a multi-tenant Controller in our VPC. This Controller
collects metrics from your Kafka Streams Applications and executes user-defined policies, the results of
which are polled by the operator.
1. **The Storage Backend**. Instead of embedding RocksDB stores, `ResponsiveKafkaStreams` offloads this
state to a natively distributed database. Today we support [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and
anything Cassandra-compatible such as [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/).
