<div className={'flex flex-col text-center items-center text-4xl font-heading'}>
    Reliable, Scalable, and Automated Kafka Streams<span className={'text-orange-500'}>.</span>
</div>

Responsive is a Kafka Streams solution that improves the reliability, scalability, and operability of Kafka Streams by

* Separating compute from storage,
* Providing policy-based and metrics-driven autoscaling,
* Adding async processing that enables you to scale beyond the Kafka partition count,
* Offering a cloud-native managed state store,
* And more.

Stop fighting with restoration, rebalancing, and resource management. Responsive's [Java SDK](/java-sdk),
[Control plane](/control-plane), and [storage solutions](/storage) collectively separate storage from
comput and automate operations while maintaining 100% compatibility with your existing code and deployment
architecture.

# Architecture Overview

The Responsive solutino comprises the Java SDK, Control plane, and storage providers as follows which combine as follows:

<div className={'flex justify-center mb-8'}>
    <img
        alt={"architecture"}
        src={require('/static/img/docs/concepts/architecture/architecture.png').default}
    />
</div>

Let's dig into how this all fits together. The entire ecosystem consists of the following "players":

1. **Kafka Provider**. Responsive is agnostic to the Kafka Cluster -- it can run self-hosted in your VPC,
in some Cloud Provider (such as Confluent, Redpanda or Warpstream) or even locally for testing.
1. **Java SDK**. These are Responsive library extensions for Kafka Streams that enable the use of remote storage, as well as
adding features like async processing, row-level TTL, and more. The SDK is a library you can add to your application
and is 100% compatible with the Kafka Streams API, which means your application code doesn't need to change in order to
get features like remote state.
1. **Responsive Operator**. Responsive provides a Helm chart to deploy the operator inside your network.
This component manages your Kafka Streams Applications, configuring and scaling up and down based
on signals it polls from a Controller service running in the Responsive managed Control Plane.
1. **Control Plane**. The Responsive Control Plane includes a Controller which monitors your app and computes the optimal
configuration based on your autoscaling policies and live application metrics. This configuration is
executed by the Operator running in your k8s cluster. The Control Plane also serves live application metrics via a
Metrics API.
1. **Storage Backend**. Instead of embedding RocksDB stores, `ResponsiveKafkaStreams` offloads this
state to a natively distributed database. Today we support [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and
anything Cassandra-compatible such as [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/), along with our own object-store native managed state store
implementation [RS3](/storage/rs3). Support for DynamoDB is also coming soon.
