:::note

This page covers the changes you need to make to support Responsive with Spring
Boot. Note that Spring Boot integration currently requires:

- An application running JDK 17
- Version `3.3.0` of `spring-kafka`
- Version `>= 0.37` of `dev.responsive.kafka-client`

We are working with the `spring-kafka` maintainer team to lift these requirements.
If your team requires a different configuration, please reach out to us at
[info@responsive.dev](mailto:info@responisve.dev).

:::

## Usage

### Configuration

In `spring-kafka` 3.3.0 we introduced a method to `KafkaStreamsCustomizer` class that allows you
to configure `ResponsiveKafkaStreams` when customizing your Kafka Streams application:

```java showLineNumbers
public class ResponsiveStreamsCustomizer extends KafkaStreamsCustomizer {

  @Override
  public KafkaStreams initKafkaStreams(
      Topology topology,
      Properties properties,
      KafkaClientSupplier clientSupplier
  ) {
    return new ResponsiveKafkaStreams(topology, properties, clientSupplier);
  }

  ...

}
```

This can be wired into the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` using the `#setKafkaStreamsCustomizer` method
on the factory bean:

```java showLineNumbers
  @Bean
  public StreamsBuilderFactoryBeanConfigurer configure() {
    return factoryBean -> {
      factoryBean.setKafkaStreamsCustomizer(new ResponsiveStreamsCustomizer());
    };
  }
```

### Disabling Autowiring for Cassandra

Spring will attempt to auto-wire Cassandra clients, which are configured manually by Responsive. You
should make sure to disable this by adding the following to your spring boot application:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {CassandraDataAutoConfiguration.class, CassandraAutoConfiguration.class})
```
