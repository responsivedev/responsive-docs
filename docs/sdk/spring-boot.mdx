:::note

This page covers the changes you need to make to support Responsive with Spring
Boot. Note that Spring Boot integration currently requires:

- An application running JDK 17
- Version `3.3.0` of `spring-kafka`
- Version `>= 0.37` of `dev.responsive.kafka-client`

We are working with the `spring-kafka` maintainer team to lift these requirements.
If your team requires a different configuration, please reach out to us at
[info@responsive.dev](mailto:info@responisve.dev).

:::

## Usage

### Dependencies

In order to use Responsive with `spring-kafka`, you must include the following
dependency:

<Tabs groupId="build-system">
    <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven" default>

        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>dev.responsive</groupId>
            <artifactId>responsive-spring</artifactId>
            <version>RESPONSIVE_CLIENT_VERSION</version>
        </dependency>
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

        ```
        implementation 'dev.responsive:responsive-spring:RESPONSIVE_CLIENT_VERSION'
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Auto-Wiring

If you use auto-wiring support for spring, replace the `@EnableKafkaStreams` annotation with
`@EnableResponsive`:

```diff java showLineNumbers
+ import dev.responsive.spring.annotations.EnableResponsive;

  @Configuration
  @EnableKafka
+ @EnableResponsive
- @EnableKafkaStreams
  public class MyKafkaStreamsConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public KStream<String, String> stream(StreamsBuilder streamsBuiler) {
      // this code remains the same
      ...
    }

  }
```

### Disabling Autowiring for Cassandra

Spring will attempt to auto-wire Cassandra clients, which are configured by Responsive. You
should make sure to disable this by adding the following to your spring boot application:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {CassandraDataAutoConfiguration.class, CassandraAutoConfiguration.class})
```

### Manual Configuration

:::warning

If you are using `KafkaStreamsCutsomizer` you **must** manually configure `ResponsiveKafkaStreams`
to avoid overriding the `@EnableResponsive` annotation. Similarly, if you specify a bean
with the name `defaultKafkaStreamsBuilder`, you should use manual configuration.

:::

In `spring-kafka` 3.3.0 we introduced a method to the  `KafkaStreamsCustomizer` class that allows you
to configure `ResponsiveKafkaStreams` when customizing your Kafka Streams application:

```java showLineNumbers
public class MyStreamsCustomizer extends KafkaStreamsCustomizer {

  @Override
  public KafkaStreams initKafkaStreams(
      Topology topology,
      Properties properties,
      KafkaClientSupplier clientSupplier
  ) {
    return new ResponsiveKafkaStreams(topology, properties, clientSupplier);
  }

  ...

}
```

This can be wired into the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` using the `#setKafkaStreamsCustomizer` method.
