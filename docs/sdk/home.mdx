<div className={'flex flex-col text-center items-center text-4xl font-heading'}>
    Essential library extensions for Kafka Streams<span className={'text-orange-500'}>.</span>
</div>

Developers love Kafka Streams for its library form factor and its rich event processing APIs. Since Kafka Streams
embeds into your applications like any other library, apps built with Kafka Streams look like every other
application you develop. You can use the same build and deployment tooling, the same observability stack, and the same
operational processes as the rest of your applications. Developers building mission-critical event driven applications
love this!

Responsive's Java SDK is designed to meaningfully extend Kafka Streams without changing its form factor. While
remaining a library, the Responsive SDK adds the following capabilities to open source Kafka Streams:

* a disaggregated state architecture, with support for MongoDB, Cassandra, [RS3](/storage/rs3), JBDC (coming soon), and
DynamoDB (coming soon) as state backends.
* async processing, which enables you to call external services from your Kafka Streams app without impacting throughput.
* row-level TTL for Responsive `StateStores`, which gives fine grained control on expiring data from your state stores.

## How the SDK works

You can think of Kafka Streams as a three layered architecture, as depicted below:

<div className={'flex mb-4 mx-auto w-3/4'}>
    <img
        alt={"RS3 architecture"}
        src={require('/static/img/docs/java-sdk/kafka-stream-architecture.png').default}
    />
</div>

### The Core Kafka Streams Runtime

The core Kafka Streams runtime can be broken into three layers depicted in blue in the diagram above:

- At the top layer, Kafka Streams exposes the DSL and PAPI APIs which you use to write powerful event driven
applications.
- Below that, Kafka Streams implements operators for functionality like streaming joins and aggregations.
- Finally, you have the thread and task management system that routes events to threads within which your processing
code is executed.

You can think of the core runtime as providing the core functionality of Kafka Streams, including modeling entities
like `KTables`, providing operators to manipulate these entities, and providing the execution model for these operators.

From a functional perspective, when people think of Kafka Streams, this is the layer they are typically thinking about.
The Responsive SDK doesn't modify this layer at all, which means that your application code will continue to function
exactly as it would without the SDK.

### The Pluggable components

The core Kafka Streams runtime relies on various subsystems, presented in orange in the diagram above. These subsystems
implement state management , task assignment, etc. and are abstracted away from the core runtime through well-defined
public interfaces.

For instance, you can swap out the state store by implementing the `StateStore` interface, and you can swap out the
task assignment mechanism by implementing the `TaskAssignor` interface. You can also swap out the Kafka Clients by
defining your own `ClientSupplier`.

These pluggable components collectively comprise the parts of Kafka Streams that make it hard to operate. For instance,
state restoration and rebalancing problems are rooted the state stores and task assignors. By swapping these out with
managed services, the Responsive SDK improves the reliability and reduces the operational burden of running Kafka Streams
without sacrificing the functionality or the form factor that developers love.
