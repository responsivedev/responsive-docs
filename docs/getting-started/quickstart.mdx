This guide demonstrates how to get a minimal Responsive environment set up and running. The example
use case implements the open source Kafka Streams Demo Application on the Responsive platform.

:::note Overview

After completing this quickstart, you will have:

1. Deployed an open source `KafkaStreams` application on a local [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster
1. Migrated the code to `ResponsiveKafkaStreams`
1. Deployed the Responsive Operator
1. Scaled your application by means of an autoscaling policy

:::

## Setup

Begin by cloning the Responsive [examples](https://github.com/responsivedev/examples.git) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/responsivedev/examples.git
cd examples
```

The `KafkaStreams` code is in the `streams-app` module, and should look familiar if you have
ever implemented "Word Count" in Kafka Streams:

```java title='Main.java' showLineNumbers
static Topology topology() {
    final StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

    ...

    final KTable<String, Long> wordCounts = textLines
        // Split each text line, by whitespace, into words.
        .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
        // Group the text words as message keys
        .groupBy((key, value) -> value)
        // Count the occurrences of each word (message key).
        .count(Materialized.as(Stores.persistentKeyValueStore("word-counts")));

    // Store the running counts as a changelog stream to the output topic.
    wordCounts
        .toStream()
        .to(OUTPUT_TOPIC, Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));

    return builder.build();
}
```

### Build & Deploy

Build a docker image containing this application, and use our script to get setup with a KinD
cluster containing a Kafka Broker, a data generator and a deployment of the Word Count application.

```bash
./gradlew :streams-app:jibDockerBuild
bash ./kind/bootstrap.sh
```

### Setup Responsive Cloud

<div className={'flex flex-col xl:grid xl:grid-cols-2 gap-4'}>
    <div>
        1. Log in or sign up to [Responsive Cloud](https://cloud.responsive.dev) and navigate to the
        Tutorial page (it's the graduation hat on the left sidebar).
        2. Follow the instructions to create an environment named `example` and an application with the id
        `my-responsive-example`.
        3. Provision a self-serve storage cluster by navigating to the `Storage` tab at the top of the
        application page and press `Provision Storage`. This may take anywhere for 3-5 minutes.
    </div>
    <img
        alt={"Tutorial"}
        src={require('/static/img/docs/getting-started/quickstart/tutorial.png').default}
        className={'drop-shadow-xl'} />
</div>

### Configure API Keys

You will need API keys for metrics as well as data storage. You can create both in the Responsive Cloud UI.

<div className={'flex flex-col xl:grid xl:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-4'}>
    <div>
        1. For the metrics API keys, navigate to the environment "Security" tab in the top navigation bar
        (or press the button to create an API Key in the Tutorial after setting the environment in the second step).
    </div>
    <img
        alt={"Create Metrics Key"}
        src={require('/static/img/docs/getting-started/quickstart/create-metrics-key.png').default}
        className={'drop-shadow-xl'} />
    <div>
        2. To create the storage API keys, first wait for the provisioning to complete and
        then create your API keys. Since you are running this locally make sure to add your local ip to the access list.
        This happens within the scope of an application (so first select your newly crated application).
    </div>
    <img
        alt={"Configure Storage"}
        src={require('/static/img/docs/getting-started/quickstart/configure-storage.png').default}
        className={'drop-shadow-xl'} />
</div>

:::warning API Key Files

When you create these keys the UI will automatically download them on to your local disk.
Note that **you will need to change the contents of these files** to match the expected configurations
(we are working on improving this!)

## Migrate to Responsive

### Code

You may either follow the steps in the tutorial UI or apply the patch below to automatically make the
required code changes.
```bash
git apply streams-app/src/main/resources/responsive-patch.diff
```

```diff showLineNumbers title="responsive-patch.diff"

     wordCounts

```

### Configs

There are two parts to the configurations:

1. the application configurations (the default is stored in `./kind/app.properties`)
1. the API secret configurations for the keys you created previously

The application configurations should be filled out by copy-pasting the configurations
displayed in the UI (omitting the secrets):

<img
    alt={"Configurations"}
    src={require('/static/img/docs/getting-started/quickstart/configurations.png').default}
    className={'drop-shadow-xl lg:px-[10%] mb-4'} />

The secrets will be loaded from the `./secrets/responsive-creds.properties` file using
Kubernetes Secrets. Make sure to update it to match the following:

```properties showLineNumbers title="responsive-creds.properties"
# metrics secrets (environment API key)
responsive.metrics.api.key=
responsive.metrics.secret=

# storage secrets
responsive.client.id=
responsive.client.secret=
```

### Rebuild & Redeploy

Now that you've migrated your code to use `ResponsiveKafkaStreams` and configured
the credentials, you can rebuild and redeploy your application using the same
commands:

```bash
./gradlew :streams-app:jibDockerBuild
bash ./kind/bootstrap.sh
```

If everything worked, you will see the processing metrics begin populating on the
application dashboard. Note that some metrics are computed by the Responsive Controller,
and will not be computed until you [configure an autoscaling policy](#configure-autoscaling).

<img
    alt={"Partial Dashboard"}
    src={require('/static/img/docs/getting-started/quickstart/partial-dashboard.png').default}
    className={'drop-shadow-xl lg:px-[10%] mb-4'} />

## Configure Autoscaling

Navigate to the [operator onboarding](https://cloud.responsive.dev/tutorial?tab=operator)
tab in the tutorial page and follow the instructions to set up operator. Once you have
operator set up, you can configure the autoscaling policy:

```bash
kubectl apply -n responsive -f ./kind/policy.yaml
```

This will register `my-responsive-example` with the operator with a policy that indicates that
whenever a single node is processing more than 2000 events per second to scale out (up to three
nodes) and whenever all nodes are processing less than 1000 events per second to scale down. You
may configure the policy with whatever parameters you'd like to see how responsive handles the
modifications.

You may begin varying the event generation rate by scaling the generator deployment up or down:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment -n responsive generator --replicas <N>
```

Each replica of the generator will generate approximately 1100 events per second, so as you scale
it up you will see the processing rate on the dashboard increase.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
    <summary className={'font-heading'}>Metrics Not Displayed on Dashboard</summary>
    <div>
    There are generally two types of issues that may cause this problem:

    1. You configured a different `responsive.applicaiton.id` in your Java app and in the Responsive UI
    1. You have a misconfigured credentials

    You can confirm the latter by checking the logs for the `example` deployment and look for
    any errors (such as `Invalid API Key or Secret`).

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n responsive deployments/example
    ```
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary className={'font-heading'}>Seeing `Invalid API Key or Secret` in the Logs</summary>
    <div>
        Make sure that you have properly configured `secrets/responsive-metrics-creds.properties` file.
        An example file looks like this:

        ```properties
        # Responsive API Credentials | responsive-kind

        responsive.metrics.api.key=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
        responsive.metrics.secret=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFG1234567890=

        ...
        ```
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary className={'font-heading'}>Getting `Exception opening socket` When Connecting to Storage</summary>
    <div>
        Make sure that you have added your local public IP address to the whitelist in the Storage tab on
        https://cloud.responsive.dev.
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary className={'font-heading'}>Helm install command failing with 403</summary>
    <div>
        Make sure that your docker credentials are valid. If you have previously logged into the public ECR
        it is likely that your credentials have expired. You can just log out of ECR:

        ```bash
        docker logout public.ecr.aws
        ```
    </div>
</details>
