- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com)
- [RS3: Responsive Streaming Storage Service](/storage/rs3)

## Considerations for choosing the right storage service

The pro's and con's of each of these services is enumerated below:

|Service|Pros|Cons|Notes|
|-------|---|----|------|
|MongoDB|Widely supported; Production Grade; Robust deployment options; Flexible indexing schemes |Uses BTree indexes, which can impact write throughput|If you already use MongoDB and don't have very large amounts of state, MongoDB may be perfect for you.|
|ScyllaDB|Production grade database; Uses LSM trees, and thus can support high volume writes at large scale | Cloud options not as mature as MongoDB | Use ScyllaDB if you have large amounts of state with high write volumes and need a high performance store. |
|RS3| Uses SlateDB with persistence on S3. Is extremely cost effective and elastic, which makes many large state apps economical. RS3 leverages it's S3 roots to make capabilities like disaster recovery and native lakehouse integration easy.|RS3 is the newest state store option of the set |RS3 was designed for cloud-native streaming applications. If you have large state and high volume usecases, this is the right choice for you.|
