:::

## Supported Storage Services

Responsive supports the following databases as Kafka Streams state stores.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com)
- [RS3: Responsive Streaming Storage Service](/storage/rs3)

## Considerations for choosing the right storage service

The pro's and con's of each of these services is enumerated below:

|Service|Pros|Cons|Notes|
|-------|---|----|------|
|MongoDB|Widely supported; Production Grade; Robust deployment options; Flexible indexing schemes |Uses BTree indexes, which can impact write throughput|If you already use MongoDB and don't have very large amounts of state, MongoDB may be perfect for you.|
|ScyllaDB|Production grade database; Uses LSM trees, and thus can support high volume writes at large scale | Cloud options not as mature as MongoDB | Use ScyllaDB if you have large amounts of state with high write volumes and need a high performance store. |
|RS3| Uses SlateDB with persistence on S3. Is extremely cost effective and elastic, which makes many large state apps economical|Is in private beta, and not yet advised for mission-critical workloads|RS3 was designed for cloud-native streaming applications. If you have large state and need a more economical remote storage option, this is the right choice for you.|
