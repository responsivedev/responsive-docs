## Welcome to Responsive

Responsive is designed to modernize the Kafka Streams architecture and streamline
mission-critical production deployments. We built the platform around these four
principles:

<div className={'flex flex-col sm:grid sm:grid-cols-3 gap-4'}>
    <Section>
        #### Separate Storage & Compute

        The primary cause of production outages can be traced back to the management
        of embedded RocksDB stores.

        Responsive offloads the work of managing a distributed database to proven storage
        systems so that Kafka Streams can focus on what it's best at: stream processing.

        #### Automate Operations

        Correctly sizing and configuring Kafka Streams deployments is a challenge
        even for the most veteran engineers.

        Responsive takes a different approach: measure the bottlenecks and automatically
        address them as necessary.

        #### Complete the Product

        Most teams that have Kafka Streams deployments which last the test of
        time tend to come up with a suite of bootstrapped tooling to help
        them operate it.

        Responsive provides that tooling and more out-of-the-box so that you
        don't have to build it.

        #### Your Code, Your Tools, and Your VPC

        Underpinning Responsive is the belief that you own your application. You
        can deploy it how you like, run it with your CI/CD tools and monitor it
        with your observability stack. We just make all that easier.

        And one more thing: when you write Responsive code, you are writing
        Kafka Streams code (and vice versa). That means you are never locked in
        to a commercial offering.

## Architecture Overview

The first two principles, separating storage from compute and automating operations, require
changing the architecture of Kafka Streams to look like this:

<img
    alt={"architecture"}
    src={require('/static/img/docs/concepts/architecture/architecture.png').default}
    className={'px-[10%] mb-4'} />

Let's dig into how this all fits together. The entire ecosystem consists of the following "players":

1. **A Kafka Cluster**. Responsive is agnostic to the Kafka Cluster -- it can run self-hosted in your VPC,
    in some Cloud Provider (such as Confluent, Redpanda or Warpstream) or even locally for testing.
1. **Your Kafka Streams Applications**. Represented in the diagram above as `java` boxes, these applications
    run on your hardware in your network. To take advantage of the Responsive autoscaling capabilities,
    these apps must run on an orchestration framework such as Kubernetes.
1. **The Responsive Operator**. Responsive provides a Helm chart to deploy the operator inside your network.
    This component manages your Kafka Streams Applications, configuring and scaling up and down based
    on signals it polls from the Responsive Controller.
1. **The Responsive Controller**. Responsive deploys a multi-tenant Controller in our VPC. This Controller
    collects metrics from your Kafka Streams Applications and executes user-defined policies, the results of
    which are polled by the operator.
1. **The Storage Backend**. Instead of embedding RocksDB stores, `ResponsiveKafkaStreams` offloads this
    state to a natively distributed database. Today we support [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and
    anything Cassandra-compatible such as [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/).
